ifab-main.py: main level iFAB welding script
Used to load a generic iFAB welding format zip file
Loops through a JSON structure and reads/manipulates 3D models based on the information contained.
Physical placement of a member is guided with a laser projection system, scanned resulting in a point cloud, and then that very accurate data is used to align the weld, so that parts which are misaligned on an absolute scale, but correct on a relative scale can succeed. We can also use this data to calculate if the relative positions are within tolerance before welding. 

usage: python ifab-main.py ifab-file.zip (-w: enables welding vs simulated welding)
