Philosophy
Start only releasing basic functionality and grow from there if necessary.

Constraints:
 - IRC5 controller.
 - 6 DOFs robotic manipulator.
 - Required PC Interface.
 - Required Multitasking (for logger).

Capabilities
 - Basic configuration: Workobject, Tool, Speed, Zone.
 - Joint, Linear and Circular moves.
 - Buffered moves (paths). With and without speed input.
 - Set external axis.
 - Optional Logger. 

Structure:
 - 1. ABB Server. (RAPID)
 - 2. Interpreter (C and Python bindings.)
 - 3. ROS interface. (written in C++)


Possible future addons
- Automatic detection and recovery of collisions, though motion supervision.
